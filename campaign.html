                Stirring awake, a Half Shadar-Kai grabbed his head as he was suffering a terrible headache from the sounds and lights that interrupted his slumber.
                <br>
                <br>“What is all this noise? It’s bad enough that I’m in this prison cell for no reason and now I have to listen to this drivel?” he moaned.
                <br>
                <br>“Yeah, well your sleep talking about the Raven Queen and her mission for you didn’t help my headache” replied Tiefling named Zigzag.
                <br>
                <br>As Laszlo was about to reply, there was another loud bang from to entrance of the hall, loud enough that it woke up the tiny Gnome and the scruffy Wood Elf too.
                <br>
                <br>“What is this? I instructed you to clear out this cell! Why are they in here?” An old man with a walking stick addressed a younger man who was obviously quaking in fear of being in trouble.
                <br>
                <br>“I am sorry, My Lord. I gave the direction, but I can see that the Warden did not take heed. I must suspect that he is aware of the reason why you requested this cell to be cleared out. If he knows why then he must be on our foes side.”
                <br>
                <br>The younger man turned to the four prisoners in the cell and addressed them.
                <br>
                <br>“You four, you have a crucial choice to make. You can stay clear of our way and allow the Emperor and I to enter this cell unharmed while we pass through or you shall meet you early deaths. I assure that even though there are four of you against our two, you are without skills and weapons to take us on. Let us enter and pass, and you are free to do as you wish as we will leave the cell door open.”
                <br>
                <br>The Gnome spoke immediately for the group before anyone else could take a breath.
                <br>
                <br>“Of course you shall enter unharmed, your gain is also our gain as well.”
                <br>
                <br>With that, the Emperor and the servant entered the cell. While the Emperor was casting a spell to open the secret passage in the back of the cell, the servant was keeping a close watch of the entrance to the hall. Just as the Emperor opened the secret passage, there was a loud noise from the hall entrance.
                <br>
                <br>“They have found us! My Lord, we must hurry!”
                <br>
                <br>He slammed the cell door shut to the protest of the Tiefling.
                <br>
                <br>“I promised your escape. Unfortunately, that was is filled with assassins. If you wish to leave then down the passage you go.”
                <br>
                <br>He and the Emperor were already gone. The four looked at each other and dashed towards the passageway. Just as they were about to go through, Loopy the Gnome noticed that Mell the Wood Elf was going towards the cell door instead.
                <br>
                <br>“Hey! You can’t go that way. For one, the door is locked. And B, assassins are coming any second!”
                <br>
                <br>“I can’t leave without my branch! It’s the only connection I have left of my mother!” He replied as he reached through the cell door bars unsuccessfully.
                <br>
                <br>With an outstretched hand, the Gnome summoned the branch through the bars and into the hands of the Wood Elf. Loopy was just as amazed as the other that the magic worked. THe Emperor must have deactivated the magic ward when he came through.
                <br>
                <br>“Now let's go!” The Tiefling drawled right as the door to the call started to break from the assassins trying to enter.
