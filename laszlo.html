                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>Raised by his human mother after his Shadar-Kai father was slain. Growing up hearing stories of how the Shadar-Kai we're from the Shadowfel who worshiped and personally served the Raven Queen, Laszlo poured his time, energy and faith into what he hoped was the wishes of the Raven Queen is efforts to be closer to his father. His mother adored the power that his father was given by the Raven Queen and spoke very highly of him often to Laszlo.
                    <br>Although his father was a highly trained assassin for the Raven Queen, Laszlo hoped to gain power through his absolute faith and service in the name of the Raven Queen. Laszlo sees his service to the Raven Queen as good since he was raised to correctly understand that the Raven Queen is not evil, but just misunderstood. So while he is good-natured, once people realize who he worships they may seem to be fearful until they see his true nature.</p>
